Unlocking this section allows you to use the Infusion Altar to enchant your armor or any Baubles item with a Runic Shield. This shield acts as the first line of defence. When you get hit, this shield absorbs the damage. Once the shield has been depleted, you will start taking damage.

Although the Thaumonomicon only lists the first 3 levels of Runic Shielding and their costs, the actual limit of Runic Shielding is 127 levels. Each level requires one Salis Mundus, one Amber per level of Runic Shielding being applied (i.e. 1 for Runic Shielding +1, 2 for Runic Shielding +2, etcetera, and a base unmodified essentia cost of 2*(10+n) Praemunio, 10+n Potentia, and 10+n Vitreus, where n is equal to
10 * 2^(level of infusion-1)

so for level 5, n would be 10 * 2 ^ 4, or 160, leaving to 170 each of Potentia and Vitrus, and 240 Praemunio, alongside 1 Salis Mundus and 5 pieces of Amber.
